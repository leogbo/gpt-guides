        // Send follow-up task to Sales team based on stage
        List<Task> tasks = new List<Task>();
        for (Opportunity opp : opps) {
            if (opp.StageName == 'Prospecting') {
                tasks.add(new Task(
                    Subject = 'Follow-up with new prospect',
                    WhatId = opp.Id,
                    Priority = 'High',
                    Status = 'Not Started'
                ));
            }
        }
        insert tasks;
    }

## 🧠 Mamba Mentality in Practice

Mamba mentality shows up in how you:
- Name variables with clarity
- Write one-line comments that actually teach something
- Refactor even when the code "works"
- Test for readability, not just coverage

> "Excellence is not optional. It's the only path forward."

Mamba doesn’t leak. Mamba doesn’t rush. Mamba teaches by example — clean, complete, and elevated.
